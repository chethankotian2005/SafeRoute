## Current Status
- ✅ App is running
- ✅ API Key is present: `AIzaSyASprxP5RkR-UaRrK1_xTsZeda7zgKrAkM`
- ✅ MapScreen loads: `LOG  MapScreen loaded, API Key present: Yes`
- ❌ Map stuck on "Initializing Google Maps..."

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

### Action 1: Check Browser Test (DO THIS NOW)
A browser window should have opened with `test-maps-api.html`

**What do you see?**
- ✅ **Green box + Map visible** → API key works! Problem is in WebView
- ❌ **Red error message** → API key has restrictions
- ⏳ **Still loading** → Wait 10 seconds then check again

### Action 2: Check Metro Bundler Console
Look at your terminal output. After you refresh the Navigate screen, you should see:

**Look for these specific messages:**
```
🌐 WebView Console: Map script starting...
🌐 WebView Console: Location: 13.3409, 74.7421
🌐 WebView Console: API Key present: true
🌐 WebView Console: Online - Loading Google Maps...
🌐 WebView Console: Google Maps API loaded successfully
🌐 WebView Console: Map initialization complete
✅ Map is ready and initialized
✅ Google Maps loaded successfully!
```

**OR error messages like:**
```
🌐 WebView Console: Device is OFFLINE
🌐 WebView Console: Google Maps API failed to load
❌ Map initialization failed: ...
```

### Action 3: Verify Internet on Phone/Emulator

On your Android device:
1. Open Chrome/Browser
2. Go to google.com
3. Make sure it loads

### Action 4: Check Google Cloud Console

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find API key: `AIzaSyASprxP5RkR-UaRrK1_xTsZeda7zgKrAkM`
3. Click on it

**Check these settings:**

**Application restrictions:**
- ❌ If "HTTP referrers (web sites)" → **CHANGE TO "None"**
- ❌ If "Android apps" → **CHANGE TO "None"** (for testing)
- ✅ If "None" → This is correct

**API restrictions:**
- ✅ Should be "Don't restrict key" OR
- ✅ Should include: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Directions API

**If you made changes:**
1. Click **SAVE**
2. Wait **2-3 minutes**
3. **Restart the app**: Press 'r' in Metro bundler

## 📊 What to Report Back:

Please tell me:

1. **Browser test result:** 
   - What color box do you see? (Green/Red/Yellow)
   - Is there a map showing?
   - What does the text say?

2. **Metro console output:**
   - Copy all lines that start with `🌐 WebView Console:`
   - Copy any lines with `❌` or `ERROR`

3. **Google Cloud Console:**
   - What does "Application restrictions" say?
   - Is it set to "None"?

4. **Internet test:**
   - Can you open websites on your phone?

## 🔧 Most Likely Solutions:

### Solution A: API Key Restrictions (90% probability)
**IF browser test shows red error:**
1. Google Cloud Console → Credentials
2. Click your API key
3. Application restrictions → Change to **"None"**
4. API restrictions → **"Don't restrict key"**
5. Save → Wait 2 minutes → Restart app

### Solution B: Internet Connection (5% probability)
**IF browser test works but phone doesn't:**
- Phone/emulator might not have internet
- Check WiFi/data connection

### Solution C: WebView Issue (5% probability)
**IF browser works AND internet works:**
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start -c
```

## ⚡ Quick Test Right Now:

**In your Metro bundler terminal, you should see new emoji logs.**

1. **On your phone:** Tap the refresh button (↻) on the Navigate screen
2. **Watch the terminal:** Look for `🌐 WebView Console:` messages
