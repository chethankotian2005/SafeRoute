## 🎯 USER FLOW (COMPLETE)

### Step 1: Open Navigate Screen
- User opens the Navigate tab
- Current location is automatically detected
- Map centers on user location

### Step 2: Search Destination
- User clicks the search bar
- Types destination (e.g., "NITK Beach", "Hospital", "Mall")
- Sees real-time suggestions (Google Places Autocomplete)
- Selects destination from dropdown

### Step 3: Route Calculation (AI-Powered)
- System fetches 3 walking routes from Google Directions API:
  - **Safest Route** (avoids highways, residential areas)
  - **Fastest Route** (most direct path)
  - **Balanced Route** (alternative option)

### Step 4: AI Safety Analysis
Each route is analyzed for safety using:
- **Lighting Score** (time-based: day/evening/night)
- **Foot Traffic Score** (peak hours, route type)
- **Safe Spot Score** (proximity to hospitals, police, public places)
- **Community Score** (Firebase reports from last 7 days)
- **Crime Score** (historical data, route type)

**Overall Score = Weighted Average:**
- Lighting: 25%
- Traffic: 20%
- Safe Spots: 20%
- Community: 20%
- Crime: 15%

### Step 5: Route Display
- All 3 routes shown on map simultaneously
- **Color-coded by safety:**
  - 🟢 Green (Score 8-10): SAFE
  - 🟠 Orange (Score 6-7.9): MODERATE
  - 🔵 Blue (varies): FASTEST
- Selected route is highlighted (thicker line)
- Non-selected routes are dimmed

### Step 6: Route Selection
- User can tap any route card to switch
- Map automatically highlights selected route
- Bottom sheet shows detailed safety breakdown
- Safety alerts displayed if any

### Step 7: Start Navigation
- User taps "Start Navigation" button
- System requests location permissions
- Turn-by-turn navigation begins
- Navigation banner appears at top

### Step 8: Active Navigation
**Navigation Banner Shows:**
- Distance to next turn (e.g., "250 m")
- Turn instruction (e.g., "Turn right onto Main Street")
- Maneuver icon (arrow, straight, U-turn, etc.)
- Stop navigation button

**Live Updates:**
- User location updates every 2 seconds
- Distance to next turn updates in real-time
- New instruction when approaching turn (< 50m)
- Voice-ready announcements

### Step 9: Route Monitoring
**Automatic Checks:**
- Distance to current step (threshold: 20m)
- Distance from route (threshold: 50m)
- Progress through navigation steps

**Route Deviation Detection:**
- If user is 50m+ off route:
  - Alert shown: "You are off the route"
  - Options: "Continue" or "Recalculate"
  - Recalculation uses current location as new origin

### Step 10: Arrival
- When user reaches final step:
  - Navigation stops automatically
  - Success message: "🎉 You have arrived!"
  - Location tracking stops
  - Navigation banner disappears

## 🧠 AI SAFETY ANALYSIS ENGINE

### Safety Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
analyzeRouteSafety(coordinates, routeType) {
  // 1. Lighting Analysis (Time-Based)
  - Daytime (6am-6pm): Score 10
  - Evening (6pm-10pm): Score 7
  - Night (10pm-6am): Score 5
  
  // 2. Foot Traffic Analysis
  - Peak hours (8-10am, 5-7pm): Higher score
  - Safest route: Score 9 (peak) / 7 (off-peak)
  - Fastest route: Score 6 (peak) / 7 (off-peak)
  - Balanced route: Score 8
  
  // 3. Safe Spots Analysis
  - Hospital/Police < 300m: Score 9
  - Safe spots < 500m: Score 7
  - Limited safe spots: Score 5
  
  // 4. Community Reports (Firebase)
  - No incidents (7 days): Score 9
  - 1-2 incidents: Score 7
  - 3+ incidents: Score 5
  - High severity reports trigger alerts
  
  // 5. Crime Data (Mock)
  - Safest route: Score 9 (low crime)
  - Fastest route: Score 6 (moderate)
  - Balanced route: Score 7 (average)
  
  // Overall Score
  = (Lighting × 0.25) 
  + (Traffic × 0.20) 
  + (SafeSpots × 0.20) 
  + (Community × 0.20) 
  + (Crime × 0.15)
}
```

### Safety Color Coding

```javascript
getRouteColor(score) {
  if (score >= 8) return '#10B981' // Green - SAFE
  if (score >= 6) return '#F59E0B' // Orange - MODERATE  
  return '#EF4444'                 // Red - CAUTION
}
```
