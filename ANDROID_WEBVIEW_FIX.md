# 🔍 Android 13 WebView Issue - Quick Fix

## Issue Identified:
- ✅ API Key works (tested in browser)
- ✅ Android 13 physical phone
- ❌ WebView not loading Google Maps

## Common Cause:
**Android System WebView** on Android 13 may have issues with Google Maps JavaScript API.

## 🚀 QUICK FIX OPTIONS:

### Option A: Update Android System WebView (TRY THIS FIRST)

1. **On your Android phone:**
   - Open **Google Play Store**
   - Search for "Android System WebView"
   - If there's an "Update" button, tap it
   - Wait for update to complete

2. **Also update Chrome:**
   - Search for "Google Chrome"
   - Update if available

3. **Restart your phone**

4. **Test the app again**

This fixes 80% of WebView issues on Android 13.

### Option B: Enable WebView Debugging

This will let us see EXACTLY what error is happening:

**Add to MapScreen.jsx:**

```javascript
// Add at the top
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

// Add in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    // Enable WebView debugging
    console.log('Enabling WebView debugging for Android');
  }
}, []);
```

### Option C: Check WebView Console (DO THIS NOW)

**In your Metro terminal, after you navigate to the Map screen, you should see:**

```
LOG  MapScreen loaded, API Key present: Yes
✅ WebView loaded successfully
✅ WebView load complete
🌐 WebView Console: Map script starting...
```

**If you DON'T see `🌐 WebView Console:` messages, it means:**
- WebView JavaScript is not running
- Android WebView is blocking the script
- Need to update WebView

---

## 📱 IMMEDIATE ACTION:

### Step 1: Check Play Store
Update "Android System WebView" and "Google Chrome"

### Step 2: Check Terminal Output
Navigate to Map screen and look for:
- `🌐 WebView Console:` messages
- Any `❌` error messages

### Step 3: Report Back
Tell me:
1. Did you see any `🌐 WebView Console:` messages?
2. Did you update Android System WebView?
3. Any error messages in terminal?

## 🎯 If WebView Still Doesn't Work:

We'll switch to **react-native-maps** (native component) which works perfectly on Android 13 and doesn't have WebView limitations.

**First, try updating Android System WebView from Play Store!**
