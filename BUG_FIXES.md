# ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… 1. Route Colors Not Changing
**Problem:** Route cards showed static colors instead of dynamic AI-based colors.

**Solution:**
- Updated route option cards to use `routes.safest?.color`, `routes.fastest?.color`, `routes.balanced?.color`
- Added fallback colors in case route data is not loaded
- Colors now automatically change based on AI safety scores:
  - Score 8-10: ðŸŸ¢ Green (#10B981)
  - Score 6-7.9: ðŸŸ  Orange (#F59E0B)
  - Score < 6: ðŸ”´ Red (#EF4444)

### âœ… 2. Start Navigation Button Missing
**Problem:** Button was present but not visually prominent.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced button styling with better contrast
- Added dynamic color: Green when idle, Red when navigating
- Improved button text: "Walking turn-by-turn guidance"
- Changed icon to `stop-circle` when navigating
- Added elevation/shadow for better visibility

### âœ… 3. View Route Details Not Working
**Problem:** Button wasn't expanding the bottom sheet.

**Solution:**
- Fixed bottomSheetRef reference with proper null check
- Changed from `bottomSheetRef.current?.snapToIndex(2)` to explicit check
- Enhanced button styling for better visibility:
  - Added background color (#F9FAFB)
  - Added border for definition
  - Increased padding for better touch target
  - Made text and icon more prominent

### âœ… 4. UI Improvements (Kept Professional & Aesthetic)
**Enhanced without changing core design:**
- Route option cards:
  - Increased padding (14 â†’ 16px)
  - Enhanced active state with better shadow
  - Larger color dots (12 â†’ 14px) with shadows
  - Active route has 2px colored border
  
- Route summary icons:
  - Dynamic colors based on selected route
  - Fallback colors for safety
  
- Status badge:
