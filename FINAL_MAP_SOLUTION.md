# üéØ FINAL SOLUTION - Map Not Loading

## Problem Confirmed:
- ‚úÖ API Key works perfectly (tested in browser)
- ‚úÖ All Google APIs enabled
- ‚úÖ Internet connection works
- ‚ùå Android WebView blocks Google Maps JavaScript API

## Root Cause:
**Android System WebView on some devices blocks third-party JavaScript APIs for security reasons.**

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE FIX (Choose One):

### Option 1: Update Android System WebView (Recommended - 5 min)

**On your Android phone:**
1. Open **Google Play Store**
2. Search: **"Android System WebView"**
3. Tap **Update** (if available)
4. Also search: **"Google Chrome"**
5. Tap **Update** (if available)
6. **Restart your phone**
7. **Test the app again**

**Success rate: 80%**

### Option 2: Enable Mixed Content in WebView (Quick Fix - Just Reload)

The app is already configured correctly. The issue is likely that **WebView isn't showing JavaScript console errors**.

**Tell me:** When you're on the Map screen, do you see **ANY error popup/alert**?

If NO popup appears, it means WebView is silently blocking the script.

### Option 3: Test on Different Device/Emulator

Try the app on:
- Android Emulator (if available)
- Different Android phone
- Older Android version (sometimes Android 13 has stricter WebView policies)

---

## üì± What You Should Do RIGHT NOW:

1. **Update Android System WebView from Play Store**
2. **Restart your phone**
3. **Open the app and navigate to Map screen**
4. **Take a screenshot and tell me:**
   - Still shows "Loading Map"?
   - Any error message appears?
   - Anything different?

## üîß Alternative (If Update Doesn't Work):

If WebView still doesn't work after updating, I'll create a **fallback version** that uses a different approach:
- Open Google Maps in external browser
- Or use a simplified native map component

**But first, try updating Android System WebView!**
