## Safety Scoring Algorithm

### Factors Analyzed (5)

1. **Lighting Score (25% weight)**
   - Daytime (6am-6pm): 10/10
   - Evening (6pm-10pm): 7/10
   - Night (10pm-6am): 5/10

2. **Foot Traffic Score (20% weight)**
   - Peak hours + Safest route: 9/10
   - Peak hours + Fastest route: 6/10
   - Off-peak + Safest route: 7/10
   - Balanced route: 8/10

3. **Safe Spot Score (20% weight)**
   - Hospital/Police < 300m: 9/10
   - Safe spots < 500m: 7/10
   - Limited safe spots: 5/10

4. **Community Score (20% weight)**
   - No incidents (7 days): 9/10
   - 1-2 incidents: 7/10
   - 3+ incidents: 5/10
   - Queries Firebase `/safety_reports`

5. **Crime Score (15% weight)**
   - Safest route: 9/10
   - Balanced route: 7/10
   - Fastest route: 6/10

### Overall Score Formula

```
Overall = (Lighting × 0.25) + 
          (Traffic × 0.20) + 
          (SafeSpots × 0.20) + 
          (Community × 0.20) + 
          (Crime × 0.15)
```

### Color Assignment

```javascript
Score >= 8.0  → 🟢 Green (#10B981) - SAFE
Score >= 6.0  → 🟠 Orange (#F59E0B) - MODERATE
Score < 6.0   → 🔴 Red (#EF4444) - CAUTION
```

4. Check safety scores
5. Start navigation
6. Walk around campus
```

### 2. Add Sample Data (Optional)
```javascript
// Add to Firebase /safety_reports
{
  "report_1": {
    "timestamp": Date.now(),
    "location": { 
      "latitude": 13.0100, 
      "longitude": 74.7947 
    },
    "type": "theft",
    "severity": "high",
    "description": "Reported incident"
  }
}
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Route calculation time
- Safety analysis speed
- Location update frequency
- Navigation accuracy

---

## Production Considerations

### API Limits
- Google Directions: 2,500 free requests/day
- Places Autocomplete: $2.83 per 1,000 requests
- Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

### Permissions
- Request location permissions upfront
- Explain why location is needed
- Handle permission denial gracefully

### Battery Usage
- Navigation uses Best accuracy (high battery)
- Consider reducing accuracy after route is familiar
- Stop tracking when navigation ends

### Error Handling
- Network failures during route calculation
- Location service disabled
- GPS signal lost
- API key issues
