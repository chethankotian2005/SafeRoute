## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Create Your Environment File (REQUIRED)

```powershell
# Copy the template
Copy-Item .env.example .env

# Then open and edit it
notepad .env
```

You need to add:
- Firebase configuration (from Firebase Console)
- Google Maps API keys (from Google Cloud Console)

**See SETUP.md for detailed instructions on getting these credentials.**

---

### Step 2: Set Up Firebase (15-20 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Create a new project called "saferoute"
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
4. Create Firestore Database
5. Create Realtime Database
6. Enable Storage
7. Copy your Firebase config to `.env`

**Detailed guide:** See `SETUP.md` - Steps 3.1 to 3.6

---

### Step 3: Set Up Google Cloud (15-20 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project called "SafeRoute"
3. Enable billing (required for Maps APIs)
4. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Directions API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
   - Street View Static API
   - Cloud Vision API
5. Create API keys
6. Copy API keys to `.env`

**Detailed guide:** See `SETUP.md` - Steps 4.1 to 4.4

---

### Step 4: Update app.json

Open `app.json` and add your Google Maps API key in two places:

```json
"android": {
  "config": {
    "googleMaps": {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
    }
  }
},
"ios": {
  "config": {
    "googleMapsApiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy Firebase Security Rules

```powershell
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project
firebase init

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database,storage
```

---

### Step 6: Run the App!

```powershell
# Start the development server
npm start
```

This will:
1. Start the Metro bundler
2. Show a QR code in your terminal
3. Give you options to run on Android, iOS, or web

**To run on your phone:**
1. Install "Expo Go" app from Play Store/App Store
2. Scan the QR code
3. App loads on your phone! 🎉
