   - Route list panel slides up from bottom
   - Routes are color-coded (green/orange/red)
   - Each route shows safety score, distance, time

### Test 2: Safety Score Verification

Compare the 3 routes and verify:
- ‚úÖ Scores are between 1-10
- ‚úÖ Each route has different color based on score:
  - Green (8-10) = SAFE
  - Orange (5-7) = MODERATE
  - Red (1-4) = UNSAFE
- ‚úÖ Routes are sorted by safety (safest first)
- ‚úÖ Safety badges show numeric scores

### Test 3: Route Selection

1. Tap on different route cards
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Selected route highlighted on map (thicker line)
   - Route card shows blue border
   - Other routes become semi-transparent

### Test 4: Navigation Start

1. Select a route (tap route card)
2. Tap **"Start Navigation"** button
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Route list panel disappears
   - Navigation panel appears at bottom
   - Shows: distance remaining, time, current instruction
   - Map zooms to user location
   - Only selected route visible on map

### Test 5: Navigation Progress

**Simulated Testing** (without walking):
1. Start navigation
2. Watch navigation panel for:
   - Distance remaining updates
   - Time remaining updates
   - Current instruction text
   - Safety indicator (colored badge)
   - SOS button present

**Real-world Testing** (recommended):
1. Start navigation for nearby destination
2. Walk along the route
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Map follows your movement
   - Instructions auto-update when reaching waypoints
   - Distance/time counts down
   - Arrival alert when destination reached

### Test 6: Emergency Features

1. During navigation, tap **SOS** button
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Navigates to SOS screen
   - Location captured for emergency

## üéì Advanced Testing

### Test Safety Score Algorithm

**Daytime Test (Should score higher)**
```
Time: 10:00 AM
Route: Main street with shops
Expected Factors:
- Daytime bonus: +2
- Foot traffic: +1 to +2
- Safe spots: +1 to +2
Expected Score: 7-9 (SAFE/MODERATE)
```

**Nighttime Test (Should score lower)**
```
Time: 11:00 PM
Route: Same main street
Expected Factors:
- Nighttime penalty: -2
- Foot traffic: -1
- Lighting may vary
Expected Score: 3-6 (MODERATE/UNSAFE)
```

### Test Edge Cases

1. **Very short distance** (< 100m)
   - Should still calculate routes
   - May show only 1-2 alternatives

2. **Very long distance** (> 10km)
   - Should suggest transit instead
   - Walking routes may be impractical

3. **No internet connection**
   - Should show error message
   - Should not crash

4. **Invalid destination**
   - Should show "Address not found" error
   - Should allow retry

5. **Denied location permission**
   - Should show permission request
   - Should explain why needed
