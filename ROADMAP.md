## üí° Development Tips

1. **Start with one feature at a time** - Don't try to build everything at once
2. **Test frequently** - Run the app after each major change
3. **Use mock data initially** - Don't wait for real API data to test UI
4. **Git commit often** - Save your progress regularly
5. **Read error messages** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
6. **Ask for help** - Don't spend hours stuck on one issue

---

## üìù Notes

- Keep all API keys secure and never commit `.env` to Git
- Test on real devices, not just emulators
- Prioritize user safety in all features
- Keep UI simple and accessible
- Document your code for future developers

**Good luck building SafeRoute! üöÄ**
