## Frontend Modifications

### HomeScreen.jsx Changes
1. ✅ Removed voice assistant imports:
   - `useVoiceAssistant` hook
   - `VoiceIndicator` component
   - `VoiceCommandModal` component

2. ✅ Removed voice assistant state variables:
   - `isListening` - Voice recognition status
   - `isActive` - Voice assistant active state
   - `isRecording` - Recording status
   - `toggleVoiceAssistant` - Toggle function
   - `manualCommand` - Manual command handler
   - `showVoiceCommands` - Modal visibility state

3. ✅ Removed voice assistant UI components:
   - VoiceIndicator component (was in hero section)
   - VoiceCommandModal component (bottom of screen)

4. ✅ Removed navigation global reference useEffect (cleanup)

## Dependencies No Longer Needed
The following npm packages are no longer actively used by the app:
- `@react-native-voice/voice` - Speech recognition
- `react-native-tts` - Text-to-speech

**Note:** These packages have NOT been uninstalled from package.json to avoid breaking the build. They can be safely removed in a future cleanup if confirmed not needed elsewhere.

## Remaining Voice Features
The following voice-related functionality is **RETAINED** as it's part of navigation:
- **NavigateScreen.jsx**: `generateVoiceInstruction` function
  - Purpose: Turn-by-turn navigation voice instructions
  - Service: `navigationService.js`
  - Scope: Limited to route guidance only

## Verification
- ✅ No compilation errors in HomeScreen.jsx
- ✅ All voice assistant files successfully removed
- ✅ No remaining imports of removed components
- ✅ File system verified clean

## Documentation Files Affected
The following documentation files reference the removed feature but are kept for historical purposes:
- `VOICE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- `VOICE_ASSISTANT_SETUP.md`
- `VOICE_QUICKSTART.md`

These can be archived or removed if desired.

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Voice assistant feature no longer available on HomeScreen
- **Navigation**: Turn-by-turn voice guidance still functional in NavigateScreen
- **Safety Features**: All other safety features remain intact
- **Performance**: Reduced app complexity and potential background processes

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Remove unused npm packages from package.json:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall @react-native-voice/voice react-native-tts
   ```

2. Archive or remove voice-related documentation files

3. Test HomeScreen thoroughly to ensure no regression
